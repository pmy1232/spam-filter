# Building a Spam Filter using the Multinomial Naive Bayes Theorem

This is my first project published on GitHub. It is a Jupyter Notebook that walks through the process of building a function that can classify text messages as spam/non-spam.
We use a dataset from [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection) that contains text messages and their spam classifications. This is a partially guided project from DataQuest.io as part of their Data Analyst learning curriculum.
